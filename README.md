Playing a list of youtube videos automatically.

Using python and selenium.
Using Tor for emulating different users.
Using threads too :)

Notes:
1. I am aware that I use "camel" style for naming functions and "_ separated" for variables. I am not sure why but I like that mix.

2. You chould change the list of videos, I have used some of my own videos in youtube. If you want to play my videos a little bit I dont care.
